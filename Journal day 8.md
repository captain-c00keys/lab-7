# Learning Journal

Gene's learning journal

I'm learning at a very slow pace and it's making me super frustrated. For some reason, I'm not thinking at the level I'm ok with. But I'll get there soon enough. I'm starting from scratch on the Cookie challenge. Using this weekend to get in touch with a buddy or two who knows web development and having them teach me a few things. Fingers crossed that it works.
